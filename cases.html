        <div class="case-section">
          <h4>Background & Context</h4>
          <p>MedTech Regional Hospital Network is a mid-sized healthcare provider operating 12 hospitals and 85 outpatient clinics across three states in the southeastern United States. With approximately 2,800 physicians and 15,000 total employees serving over 450,000 patients annually, the organization has built a strong reputation for clinical excellence over its 35-year history.</p>
          
          <p>However, the network faced mounting pressure from multiple stakeholders. Patient satisfaction scores had declined from 82% to 71% over the past 18 months, primarily driven by frustrations with appointment scheduling, wait times, and fragmented communication. Simultaneously, the organization was experiencing operational inefficiencies with average patient check-in times of 23 minutes, medical record retrieval delays averaging 48 hours between facilities, and administrative costs consuming 28% of total operating expenses—well above the industry benchmark of 18-22%.</p>
          
          <p>The executive leadership team recognized that their legacy IT infrastructure, which included five disparate electronic health record (EHR) systems across different facilities, paper-based processes in 40% of clinics, and no integrated telehealth capabilities, was creating a competitive disadvantage as newer healthcare providers entered the market with digital-first experiences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-section">
          <h4>Key Data Points & Market Context</h4>
          <ul class="data-points-list">
            <li><strong>Current State Performance:</strong> Patient satisfaction score of 71% (down from 82% in 18 months); average patient wait time of 47 minutes; 23-minute average check-in process; 28% administrative cost ratio</li>
            
            <li><strong>Technology Infrastructure:</strong> Five disparate EHR systems across facilities; 40% of clinics still using paper-based processes; zero telehealth infrastructure; average system downtime of 3.2 hours per month causing appointment cancellations</li>
            
            <li><strong>Financial Impact:</strong> Annual revenue of $1.2 billion; estimated $28 million in annual revenue leakage due to appointment no-shows (18% no-show rate); administrative overhead costs of $336 million annually; IT maintenance costs at $42 million per year</li>
            
            <li><strong>Competitive Landscape:</strong> Two new digital-native healthcare providers entered the market in the past 12 months, capturing 8% market share; 67% of patients ages 25-45 now prefer providers offering digital appointment booking and telehealth options</li>
            
            <li><strong>Regulatory Environment:</strong> Recent state legislation mandating interoperability standards by 2026; federal incentive programs offering $15-20 million in funding for qualified digital health investments; upcoming data privacy regulations requiring enhanced security protocols</li>
            
            <li><strong>Patient Demographics:</strong> 62% of patient base is over 50 years old, but the 25-45 age segment represents the fastest-growing cohort (18% annual growth); 73% of patients own smartphones; 45% have expressed interest in telehealth services in recent surveys</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="case-section">
          <h4>Consulting Questions & Analytical Tasks</h4>
          <ol class="consulting-questions">
            <li>
              <strong>Strategic Prioritization & ROI Analysis:</strong> Given the hospital network's budget constraint of $50 million for digital transformation over 24 months and the multiple pain points identified (patient experience, operational efficiency, competitive positioning), develop a prioritization framework to determine which digital initiatives should be implemented first. Calculate the expected ROI for the top three priority initiatives, considering both hard savings (cost reduction) and soft benefits (patient satisfaction, market share retention). What would be your recommendation for the phased implementation approach?
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <strong>Technology Integration & Change Management:</strong> The organization currently operates five different EHR systems across its facilities, creating data silos and interoperability challenges. Analyze the trade-offs between three potential approaches: (a) implementing a single unified EHR system across all facilities, (b) creating an integration layer to connect existing systems, or (c) a hybrid approach with gradual migration. For your recommended approach, design a change management strategy that addresses physician resistance (62% of surveyed physicians expressed concern about workflow disruption) and develop a training roadmap for 15,000 employees.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <strong>Patient Portal & Telehealth Business Case:</strong> The executive team is particularly interested in launching a patient portal with telehealth capabilities. Based on the data provided (18% appointment no-show rate, 45% patient interest in telehealth, demographic trends), build a business case for this initiative. Estimate the potential impact on appointment no-shows, patient acquisition in the 25-45 age segment, and reduction in facility-based visit costs. What pricing strategy would you recommend for telehealth services, and how would you ensure clinical quality is maintained?
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <strong>Operational Efficiency Optimization:</strong> Administrative costs represent 28% of total operating expenses versus an industry benchmark of 18-22%. Using the provided data on check-in times, wait times, and process inefficiencies, identify the top three operational processes that should be digitized or automated first. Quantify the potential cost savings and efficiency gains for each. What metrics would you establish to track the success of these operational improvements, and what would be realistic targets for Year 1 and Year 2?
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <strong>Competitive Response & Market Positioning:</strong> With two digital-native competitors having captured 8% market share in 12 months and targeting the younger, tech-savvy demographic, develop a competitive response strategy for MedTech. How should the hospital network position its digital transformation efforts in the market? Should they pursue a differentiation strategy based on their clinical reputation combined with new digital capabilities, or compete directly on digital experience? Design a go-to-market approach for the new digital services that addresses both patient acquisition and retention, including recommended marketing spend allocation and key messaging.
